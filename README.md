## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. Ensure your Spotify API credentials are correct
2. Check your internet connection
3. Clear your browser cache
4. Try running `npm install` again


If you ran "npm run start" you will have to run "npm run build" to build the production version of the app. After that you can run "npm run serve" to serve the production version of the app.
If not you will get various errors that are not really errors like:

react-beautiful-dnd.esm.js:39 react-beautiful-dndUnable to find draggable with id: (contentHere)üë∑‚Äç This is a development only message. It will be removed in production builds.
